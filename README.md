![alt text](https://github.com/StudioFolder/european-motorways/blob/master/VAM_European-Motorways_screen-01.png)

This repository contains the data collected and produced for the visualisation published here: https://www.vam.ac.uk/commission/european-motorways-1920–2020.

"The Evolution of European Motorways 1920–2020" has been commissioned by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and has been developed as part of the exhibition "[Cars: Accelerating the Modern World](https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/cars)," curated by Brendan Cormier (23 November 2019—19 April 2020). It shows the history of the motorways network's growth across Europe over a period of 100 years, while providing additional information on the political, economical and cultural context within its development. 

While initially collected from the sources listed below, a loto of work has been put into the analysis, integration, and refinement of the transportation network data presented here.
