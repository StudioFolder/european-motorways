# The Evolution of European Motorways, 1920â€”2020

This repository contains the datasets created for the visualisation published here: https://www.vam.ac.uk/commission/european-motorways-1920â€“2020.

"The Evolution of European Motorways 1920â€“2020" has been commissioned by the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and has been developed as part of the exhibition "[Cars: Accelerating the Modern World](https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/cars)," curated by Brendan Cormier (23 November 2019â€”19 April 2020). It shows the history and growth of motorways across Europe over a period of a hundred years, and it provides additional information on the political, economical and cultural context of their development. 

While initially collected from the sources listed below, a lot of work has been put into the analysis, integration, and refinement of the transportation network data used in the visualisation and shared here.
---

The new and updated datasets are made available here.

* **European Motorways**. The original vector files from OpenStreetMap have been simplified and consolidated, while the construction dates for each motorway's segment have been added to the dataset. Each motorways is presented as a single-line feature with the following attributes: </br>
`int_ref`: International reference number </br>
`ref`: National reference number </br>
`country`: ISO ALPHA-3 country code </br>
`start_year`: year of start of construction (`0` when unknown) </br>
`end_year`: year of end of construction </br>
`length`: length in meters </br>
</br>
An example of the attributes' table can be found below:

| int_ref        | ref           | country  | start_year  | end_year  | length  |
|:------------- |:------------- |:----- |:----- |:----- |:----- |
| E 451 | A 51 | DEU | 1933 | 1935 | 440392 |


The dataset can be downloaded from here. 

* **Pan-European Transport Corridors**. The dataset can be downloaded from here.

* **Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T)**. The dataset can be downloaded from here.
